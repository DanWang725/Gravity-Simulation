## Gravity-Simulation
Just a little fun project to test out gravity simulation

As of right now you can't do anything during runtime except watch the simulation run. All of the variables are set in the unity editor.

# Beta Branch

This serves as the respository for major reworks and features.

Currently for a rework of the gravity formulas and orbiting objects.
