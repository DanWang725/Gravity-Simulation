## Gravity-Simulation
Just a little fun project to test out gravity simulation

As of right now you can't do anything during runtime except watch the simulation run. All of the variables are set in the unity editor.

# Current To-do list
- [ ] Allow users to create planets and set their own properties
- [ ] Creation of the large planets that influence orbiting planets
- [ ] Fix camera bug with spectating objects not updating the stored rotation
- [ ] Add a predicted path line for each orbiting object
- [ ] Add textures to all planets

# Previous Beta Branch

This serves as the respository for major reworks and features.

Currently for a rework of the gravity formulas and orbiting objects.

Todo:
- [x] Optimize core gravity functions
- [x] Re-organize code and functions
- [x] Add ui list of current planets
- [x] Add toggles for displaying vectors
- [ ] Create planets with random positions and velocities
