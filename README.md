## Gravity-Simulation
Started out as a project for my physics class for a gravity simulation.

Right now simulates the obit of objects around 1 or more planets (currently mass of mars). Create as many objects as you like to orbit these planets. Will display the force and velocity vectors of each object as well.

# Current To-do list
- [ ] Allow users to create planets and set their own properties
- [ ] Creation of the large planets that influence orbiting planets
- [x] Fix camera bug with spectating objects not updating the stored rotation
- [ ] Add a predicted path line for each orbiting object
- [ ] Add textures to all planets
- [ ] Add a start menu
- [ ] Add a pause menu
- [ ] Be able to exit the program within runtime

# Previous Beta Branch

This serves as the respository for major reworks and features.

Currently for a rework of the gravity formulas and orbiting objects.

Todo:
- [x] Optimize core gravity functions
- [x] Re-organize code and functions
- [x] Add ui list of current planets
- [x] Add toggles for displaying vectors
- [x] Create planets with random positions and velocities
